# Example of DRb serving distributed objects on network

DRb service example 

Server generates random prices and fakes a pub / sub system for clients to subscribe.
Clients connect to the server, subscribe to pub / sub and print lower and higher values based on preferences.

This code example goes along with a blog post on [Synbioz blog](http://www.synbioz.com/blog) which explains what is [DRb](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/drb/rdoc/DRb.html) and how to use it.
